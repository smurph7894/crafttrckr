# CraftTrckr

CraftTrckr is a website idea for taking steps of projects/hobbies one is currently working on. Future additions will allow for users to view each others projects, search by key words, and message each other.

## Deployed Website
http://34.220.179.145/

## Getting Started

### Add an .env file.

* To run this code locally you'll need to add a .env file with your own secret keys added
    FIRST_SECRET_KEY="enter yours here"
    SECOND_SECRET_KEY="enter yours here"

### Images

* Please note that in the deployed version the image upload does not currently upload. Currently they are saved on the web server. Ideally in future I'd use S3 or another equivlient.
